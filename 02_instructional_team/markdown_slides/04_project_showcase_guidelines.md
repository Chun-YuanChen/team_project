# Project Submission

* The DSI team will begin evaluating your projects and providing feedback next Monday, July 28th.

* We encourage you to record your videos after the Project Showcase, as you will likely get some good ideas on how to describe your project!

# Project Submission

* Remember to clean up your repository.
    * Organize folders and include supporting documentation appropriately.
    * E.g. link from your main README to subfolders for additional information where applicable.
    * Remove unused files and folders.
    * Make sure your code is commented.

# Project Showcase

* **The showcase will start at 09:00am ET on Saturday, July 26th.**

* Each team will have 5 minutes to present your project. We will not be taking questions after each presentation, but if you do have questions for another team please write them down and we will go over them if there is time.

* It is up to your time how you wish to divide the presentation duties among team members.

* _Let us know by today (Thursday) if none of your team members are available to attend, or if you have specific scheduling constraints._

# Project Showcase

* This is not a lot of time, so you should not try to describe every step of your project. Instead, think of it as an "elevator pitch".
    * Assume that the audience is not an expert in your industry. Provide the required context.
    * Who are your intended stakeholders and why should they care about your project?
    * Explain your dataset in a way that your audience can understand.
    * BRIEFLY describe the tools/technologies that you used.
    * What are the key outcomes and takeaways? What is the business impact of your findings? Highlight one or two key visualizations or metrics.
    * If you had more time, what would your team have explored next?
