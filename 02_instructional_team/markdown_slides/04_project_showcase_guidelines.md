```
$ echo "Data Sciences Institute"

# Project Submission

* The DSI team will begin evaluating your projects and providing feedback next Monday, November 17th.

* We encourage you to record your videos after the Project Showcase, as you will likely get some good ideas on how to describe your project!

# Project Submission

* Remember to clean up your repository.
    * Organize folders and include supporting documentation appropriately.
    * E.g. link from your main README to subfolders for additional information where applicable.
    * Remove unused files and folders.
    * Make sure your code is commented.

# Project Showcase

* **The showcase will start at 09:00am ET on Saturday, November 15th.**

* Each team will have 5 minutes to present your project. We will not be taking questions after each presentation, but if you do have questions for another team please write them down and we will go over them if there is time.

* It is up to your time how you wish to divide the presentation duties among team members.

* _Let us know by today (Thursday) if none of your team members are available to attend, or if you have specific scheduling constraints._

# Project Showcase

- This day is for showcasing your progress on the project goals so far. It is about presenting what your project is about, what you’ve done, and what you plan to do next. It’s also a chance to get feedback and ideas from your fellow participants. 

- Put your best foot forward, as you may never get such a diverse audience of this size again. The audience is comprised of your fellow participants, who now have a good background in data science and machine learning, and have extensive expertise in their respective industries. They will provide valuable feedback.

# Project Showcase

* This is not a lot of time, so you should not try to describe every step of your project. Instead, think of it as an "elevator pitch".
    * Assume that the audience is not an expert in your industry. Provide the required context.
    * Who are your intended stakeholders and why should they care about your project?
    * Explain your dataset in a way that your audience can understand.
    * BRIEFLY describe the tools/technologies that you used.
    * What are the key outcomes and takeaways? What is the business impact of your findings? Highlight one or two key visualizations or metrics.
    * If you had more time, what would your team have explored next?

# Next Steps Post-Certification

As you transition from the certificate, continue to build and showcase your skills.

### Strategies for Continuous Growth:

- **Active Portfolio**: Aim for 5-6 substantial projects to demonstrate a broad range of skills. Focus on quality over quantity.
- **Explore and Learn**: Continue exploring new areas within data science and machine learning to keep your knowledge current and dynamic.
- **Peer Collaboration**: Participate in group projects with fellow participants to enhance your skills and widen your professional network.

Actively applying for jobs should proceed in tandem with these activities.

<!-- Speaker notes: Emphasize that maintaining a portfolio with 5-6 diverse projects is ideal for demonstrating a commitment to the field and depth of skills. Clarify that the focus should be on the quality of projects rather than simply meeting a numerical target. Encourage participants to continuously apply for jobs, using their portfolios to strengthen their applications and showcase their ongoing engagement and expertise. Remind them that even after the modules end, they still have access to the Slack community (more information will come out later). This platform can be a valuable resource for finding project partners, asking questions, and getting feedback on their work. Additionally, advise them to present completed projects on LinkedIn. This not only timestamps their active engagement in relevant projects during job searches but also enhances their visibility and personal branding on a professional network. -->
