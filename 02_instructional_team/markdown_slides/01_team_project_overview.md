---

# Project Requirements

---
# Final Project Submission

Your final project will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1. Each team member must have created a pull request, and reviewed and merged a different pull request.

2. (a) For **Data Science** teams, your project must include at least one visualization that presents new insights into the chosen dataset.

   (b) For **Machine Learning** teams, your project must include at least one machine learning model that you have developed and implemented to obtain new insights.

---

# Final Project Submission

3. Each project's README should describe the project objective, the final outcome of the project, the key business takeaways, and describe your team's approach to working collaboratively. It should also demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the guiding questions listed in this repository's README.

---

# Final Project Submission

4. Your project should be ***completely reproducible***. This means that anyone (e.g. the instructional team for marking, or potential employers for evaluating your work) should be able to completely recreate your analysis and results based on the instructions in your repository. This includes any software and data dependencies. You should test this by trying to regenerate your results from scratch.

---

# Final Project Submission

5. Each team member must record a 3-5 minute video reflecting on your experience. You may each choose where to host your own video, however _it should be public and a link to each team member's video should be included in your project README_. This video is meant to be an asset to your portfolio, and should be available for prospective employers. Your videos should answer the following questions:
    * What did you learn?
    * What challenges did you face?
    * How did you overcome those challenges?
    * If you had more time, what would you add?
    * What strengths do you bring to a team environment?

---

# Expectations for Week 1

After Week 1, you will only be evaluated on your project's README file. By this point, it must include a detailed project proposal. This should include:

1. The business motivation for your project.
2. Which dataset you have chosen to use
3. Risks or unknowns that you have identified.
4. How you will approach the analysis.
5. Breakdown of roles/tasks assigned to each team member.

# Working as a Team

---

# Effective GitHub Repository Organization

- Ensure your GitHub repository is neatly organized; avoid unused or empty folders and ensure each folder has a clear purpose.
- Use READMEs in key folders (like `src`, `iac`, `backend`, `frontend`, etc.) to detail their contents and purpose, aiding clarity for complex sections.
- Avoid READMEs in simple folders (like `images`, `docs`, etc.), unless there's specific information that needs to be explained.

---

# Managing your Repository as a Team

- Do not commit directly to the `main` branch!
- Each feature should be developed in its own branch, then merged into `main` when it has been completed and tested.

---

# Managing your Repository as a Team

## Workflow for feature development

1. Pull the latest code from the remote `main` branch to your local `main` branch.
2. Create a new branch from `main`, named according to the feature you are working on.
3. As you develop your feature, make sure you are regularly committing your changes and pushing them to the remote feature branch.
4. Once you have finished developing and testing, create a Pull Request to merge the feature branch into the `main` branch.
5. Make sure another team member is assigned to review and merge the PR.

---

## Merge Conflicts

It is likely that you will encounter merge conflicts when combining your work as a team.
Make sure you've reviewed the Git material regarding how to resolve merge conflicts properly!

# Writing Clear Documentation (README & Comments)

While you can have multiple README files in your repository, include only one README file per folder to keep things clean and simple. This structure showcases your ability to manage and present complex information effectively, increasing your appeal to potential employers.

**Effective commenting enhances code readability and maintainability, crucial for collaborative environments.**

# Writing Clear Documentation (README & Comments)


If someone with no technical background reads your code, they should get the essence of what you are doing and how the code flows. This practice not only aids in understanding but also facilitates smoother transitions and updates within team projects.

## Example

❌
```
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
    return price * quantity;
}

let totalPrice = calculateTotal(25, 5);
console.log(totalPrice); // Output: 125
```

✅
```
// Calculates the total cost by multiplying the price per item with the quantity
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
    return price * quantity;
}

// Example usage: Calculates the total price for 5 items at $25 each by multiplying the price per item ($25) 
// with the quantity (5), and stores the result in the totalPrice variable.
let totalPrice = calculateTotal(25, 5);
console.log(totalPrice); // Output: 125
```

---

# Project Structure

* **One** person from each team must host the primary Git repository. Other team members should clone that repository to work on it.

* There is no hard requirement for the folder structure of your project, but best practices should be followed.

# Working as a Team

The following two weeks will fly by quickly! How will you ensure that you can accomplish everything you need to as a team in this timeframe?

---

## Working as a Team

1. **Clear objectives and milestones**. Milestones should be set working backward from the final project goal and deadline.

2. **Accountability**. Every action item should have someone assigned. (Of course, the assigned person can change if workloads become unbalanced.)

3. **Communication of roadblocks**. It is just as important to communicate roadblocks and failures as successes. The faster problems are identified, the faster they can be addressed.

---

## Working as a Team

4. **Tracking**. Tracking your tasks is necessary to objectively assess your progress as a team. The data-driven mindset applies here too! If you fall behind, update your plan accordingly. 

5. **Documentation**. Team members should be able to understand and continue each others' work where necessary.
