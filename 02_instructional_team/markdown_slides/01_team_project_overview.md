# Final Project Submission

3. Each project's README should describe the project objective, the final outcome of the project, the key business takeaways, and describe your team's approach to working collaboratively. It should also demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the [guiding questions](#reviewing-your-dataset).

---

# Final Project Submission

4. Your project must include ***one completely reproducible feature***. This could be a single visualization, training and storing a model, or using a previously trained model to predict results, and the value of the feature should be described in your README. It could be formatted as a self-contained Jupyter notebook or a script, however anyone new to your project should be able to reproduce it based on the instructions provided, including any software, data, or file dependencies.

---

# Final Project Submission

5. Each team member must record a 3-5 minute video reflecting on your experience. You may each choose where to host your own video, however _it should be public and a link to each team member's video should be included in your project README_. This video is meant to be an asset to your portfolio, and should be available for prospective employers. Your videos should answer the following questions:
    * What did you learn?
    * What challenges did you face?
    * How did you overcome those challenges?
    * If you had more time, what would you add?
    * What strengths do you bring to a team environment?

---

# Expectations for Week 1

After Week 1, you will be evaluated on your project's README file. By this point, it must include a detailed project proposal. This should include the business motivation for your project, the dataset you have chosen to use, and any risks or unknowns you have identified.

# Working as a Team

## GitHub

---

# Effective GitHub Repository Organization

- Ensure your GitHub repository is neatly organized; avoid unused or empty folders and ensure each folder has a clear purpose.
- Use READMEs in key folders (like `src`, `iac`, `backend`, `frontend`, etc.) to detail their contents and purpose, aiding clarity for complex sections.
- Avoid READMEs in simple folders (like `images`, `docs`, etc.), unless there's specific information that needs to be explained.

---

# Managing your Repository as a Team

- Do not commit directly to the **main** branch!
- Each feature should be developed in its own branch, then merged into **main** when it has been completed and tested.

---

# Merge Conflicts

It is likely that you will encounter merge conflicts when combining your work as a team.
Make sure you've reviewed the Git material regarding how to resolve merge conflicts properly!

# Crafting a Comprehensive Main README File

- **Purpose & Overview:** Introduce the project with essential details, concise description and a project objective.
- **Goals & Objectives:** Articulate what the project aims to achieve.
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Highlight the tools and methods used.
- **Key Findings & Instructions:** Summarize outcomes and provide setup instructions.
- **Visuals & Credits:** Enhance with visuals; acknowledge contributors.

<!-- 
Focus on the essence of what makes a README effective: clarity and conciseness. A well-organized README provides a snapshot of the project, helping others quickly understand its value and how to engage with it. Ensure that each element is presented in a way that contributes to an overall understanding of the project.
-->

# Writing Clear Documentation (README & Comments)

While **you can have multiple README files** in your repository, include only one README file per folder to keep things clean and simple. This structure showcases your ability to manage and present complex information effectively, increasing your appeal to potential employers.

**Effective commenting enhances code readability and maintainability, crucial for collaborative environments.**

If someone with no tech background reads your code, they should get the essence of what you are doing and how the code flows. This practice not only aids in understanding but also facilitates smoother transitions and updates within team projects.

## Example

❌
```
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
    return price * quantity;
}

let totalPrice = calculateTotal(25, 5);
console.log(totalPrice); // Output: 125
```

✅
```
// Calculates the total cost by multiplying the price per item with the quantity
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
    return price * quantity;
}

// Example usage: Calculates the total price for 5 items at $25 each by multiplying the price per item ($25) 
// with the quantity (5), and stores the result in the totalPrice variable.
let totalPrice = calculateTotal(25, 5);
console.log(totalPrice); // Output: 125
```

# Project Structure

* **One** person from each team must host the primary Git repository. Other team members should clone that repository to work on it.

* There is no hard requirement for the folder structure of your project, but best practices should be followed.

# Working as a Team

The following two weeks will fly by quickly! How will you ensure that you can accomplish everything you need to as a team in this timeframe?

---

## Working as a Team

1. **Clear objectives and milestones**. Milestones should be set working backward from the final project goal and deadline.

2. **Accountability**. Every action item should have someone assigned. (Of course, the assigned person can change if workloads become unbalanced.)

3. **Communication of roadblocks**. It is just as important to communicate roadblocks and failures as successes. The faster problems are identified, the faster they can be addressed.

---

## Working as a Team

4. **Tracking**. Tracking your tasks is necessary to objectively assess your progress as a team. The data-driven mindset applies here too! If you fall behind, update your plan accordingly. 

5. **Documentation**. Team members should be able to understand and continue each others' work where necessary.

---

# Prepping You for the Industry  

- Throughout the certificate, we’ve introduced the analogy:  
  - **Participants → Junior Data Professionals**  
  - **Learning Supports → Senior Data Professionals**  
  - **Technical Facilitators → Product Managers**  
- We’re now taking this further by incorporating **stand-up meetings**, a common practice in professional data teams.  
- Stand-ups help teams **stay aligned, communicate blockers, and improve efficiency**.  
- By practicing stand-ups, you’ll develop **strong communication and collaboration skills** that are essential in the workplace.  

---

# Daily "Standups"

* Each day, a member of the DSI instructional team will guide your team through a stand-up.  
* Stand-ups are **quick, structured check-ins** that help teams stay on track and remove obstacles.  
* The goal is not to compete for who did the most work—it’s to ensure the entire team is working effectively and efficiently.  
* This is a great opportunity to help your teammates and **resolve blockers early**.  
* Stand-ups should take no more than **10 minutes**.  

---

# Daily "Standups"  

* Each team member should describe:  
  * What did you work on yesterday?  
  * What will you be working on today?  
  * Are you unsure about any of your tasks?  
  * Are you blocked by anything?  

<!-- 
Standups are not intended to see who has done the most work or who is slacking. They are a collaborative way to ensure that all team members know who is working on what, and whether anyone is stuck on their task and needs help. They are also extremely helpful in identifying blockers that may not be obvious. DSI team should emphasize the collaborative aspect of this and not put anyone on the spot. Learning should also be considered as a "task".
-->
